<body>
This is where the blah blah goes>
<h1>Heres a heading</h1>
ANd how we <b>bold</b> things and how we make them <i>italicised.</i>
<p>New paragraph.</p>
<h2>And a new heading</h2>
But we wish to make sure the <i>paragrah</i> ends.</p>
And thus it does and that takes us to another <h3>heading</h3>
<p>of which we then add more paragraphs to do part of this exercise</p>
<h4>But we still have</h4>
<h5>more headings </h5>
<h6>to come.</h4>
<p>This is where I add the fancy bit to open a new window, and to open the same window.
Also an image <img src="http://www.zooborns.com/.a/6a010535647bf3970b0167692fc3a3970b-500wi">
and then an image that opens a webpage </p>
